# Cache Simulator
In this project, we have built a cache simulator which can be used to study the effectiveness of various cache configurations.

## How to Use?
Download the code on your local systems and run the following: 
```console
#Make sure you have gcc installed on your system (preferably Ubuntu/Linux)
make
make cacheSim   # to compile and link the source files and generate an executable
```
